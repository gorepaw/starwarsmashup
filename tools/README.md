# Tools

Offline asset tools. Nothing here contains game data.

## Build

Requires Visual Studio 2022 (C++ workload) and CMake 3.28+. zlib is fetched at configure time.

```powershell
cmake --preset msvc
cmake --build --preset msvc-release
ctest --preset msvc-release
```

## swgtool

```
swgtool list <archive.tre>
swgtool manifest <dir> --name <name> --source <text> -o <out.tsv>
swgtool coverage <manifest.tsv> <dir> [--missing <out.tsv>]
swgtool iff <archive.tre> <path>
swgtool iff-check <dir>
```

- **list**: print every file in a TRE archive (uncompressed size, stored size, compressed flag, path).
- **manifest**: hash the uncompressed contents of every file in every `.tre` under `<dir>` and write a reference manifest. Refuses to write if any archive or file fails to read.
- **coverage**: compare an install against a reference manifest. For each reference file it reports `matched` (byte-identical at the same path), `moved` (identical, but only under another path), `changed` (path exists, contents differ), or `absent`, plus a per-folder breakdown and a count of install files that aren't in the reference.

- **iff**: print the chunk tree of one IFF file inside an archive, with a hex preview of each chunk's data.
- **iff-check**: parse every IFF file in every archive under `<dir>` and print per-extension counts, failures, and root form names. On the Total Experience set, all 130,954 IFF files parse with no failures.

Supported archives: TRE `0005` (retail discs) and plain `0006`. SWG Restoration's `0006` archives encrypt their file data and are reported as unsupported. We don't decrypt them.

## Manifests

`manifests/` holds reference manifests: one line per file with `sha256 size archive path`. See [Supported game versions](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#supported-game-versions).

| Manifest | Source | Files |
|---|---|---|
| `swg-total-experience-2005.tsv` | *Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience* (LucasArts, 2005), 5 CDs, cabinets extracted with unshield 1.6.2 | 173,289 entries, 140,103 unique paths, 5.4 GiB uncompressed |

To reproduce it from your own discs:

```powershell
unshield -d <extracted> x <cabs>\data1.hdr
swgtool manifest "<extracted>\Star_Wars_files" --name swg-total-experience-2005 --source "..." -o out.tsv
```
